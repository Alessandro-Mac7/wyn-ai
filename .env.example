# SUPABASE AUTH CONFIGURATION (REQUIRED!)
# ============================================
# You MUST also configure these settings in Supabase Dashboard:
#
# 1. Go to: Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration
#
# 2. Set "Site URL" to your production URL:
#    - Production: https://your-domain.vercel.app
#    - This is used as the base URL for magic link emails
#
# 3. Add ALL redirect URLs to "Redirect URLs":
#    - http://localhost:3000/auth/callback (development)
#    - https://your-domain.vercel.app/auth/callback (production)
#
# Without these settings, magic links will redirect to localhost!
